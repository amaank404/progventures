# Progventures

Open-source goodies. Here is a free game for the open
source community. Programmers aren't few but games
catered to them are so being bored to death, I decided
to make my own game. Inspired from assembly language,
I present you `Progventures`.

## Game Pitch (Advertising Description kinda thingy)
Have you been bored! Are youuuu Programmer!? You, yes
you are at the right place. Presenting to you, Progventures.

* Help your boss, He is who controls you.
  Help him break the OS to gain control. The bigger
  your control, the more abilities you unlock. The
  more you unlock, The closer to Purification.

* Go across 8 Operating System as the timeline passes.
  The later you go, the more secure it is and
  harder it gets.
